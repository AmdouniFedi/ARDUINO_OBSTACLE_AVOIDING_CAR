# ARDUINO_OBSTACLE_AVOIDING_CAR

An Arduino-based robot car that can detect and avoid obstacles using ultrasonic sensors.

## 🚗 Features
- Detects obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor
- Automatically changes direction to avoid collisions
- Built using Arduino Uno and basic motor drivers

## 🧠 Components
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- L298N Motor Driver
- 2 DC Motors
- Servo motor
- Power supply (battery pack)

## ⚙️ How It Works
The car continuously measures the distance ahead using the ultrasonic sensor.  
If an obstacle is detected within a certain range, it stops, turns, and continues moving forward once the path is clear.
